# RShiny_Teaching_Apps

This repo contains the code for various RShiny documents used to illustrate basic statistical concepts, predominantly those covered in undergraduate courses at the University of Cape Town.

Here are the URL links to access the published apps:

- [The Bias-Variance Trade-off](https://stefanbritz.shinyapps.io/Bias-Variance_Trade-off/)
- [The Central Limit Theorem](https://stefanbritz.shinyapps.io/central_limit_theorem_illustration/)
- [The Distribution of the Mean and Variance of a Sample](https://stefanbritz.shinyapps.io/Sample_Statistics_Dist/)
- [The Bivariate Gaussian Distribution](https://stefanbritz.shinyapps.io/Bivariate_Gaussian/)

Update \[14/03/2022\] -- The bivariate Gaussian makes use of the RGL library. This yields an error in Firefox. Seems to work fine in Chrome.
